                            Arctic Monkeys are heralded as one of the first bands to gain public attention via the Internet (via fan-based sites rather than the band's), with many music observers considering them to represent a possible change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.[7] Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in British history, and was declared one of the best debut albums. It won the best album award at the 2007 Brit Awards. The band then released their second album Favorite Worst Nightmare (2007), which also received praise from critics and again managed to win the best album award at the 2008 Brit Awards. They then released the album Humbug (2009) , and Suck It and See (2011).

                            Arctic Monkeys achieved international success with their fifth album AM (2013), which was supported by the international hit Do I Wanna Know?. It became their highest-charting album on the American Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum. At the 2014 Brit Awards, for the third time they won the best album award. Their sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), is very different from their previous album, which was dominated by piano, and not guitar like their previous album.

                            Arctic Monkeys have sold more than 23 million albums worldwide. In England, they became the first independent label band to reach number one with their first five albums. They have won 7 Brit Awards (becoming the first band to win both best album and best band three times), one Mercury Prize, one Ivor Novello Award, and twenty NME Awards. In addition, they were nominated for a Grammy Award five times.
